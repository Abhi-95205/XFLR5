## Week 2
#### The final goal at the end of the week would be that you would learn:
* To design a fixed-wing drone using the mission parameters.<br/>
* Learn how to analyse a 3D plane design in XFLR5.


So let’s start with what exactly a mission will typically look like, a mission typically gives you parameters that your UAV should satisfy. It would include Range, Endurance, payload, sometimes even things like takeoff distance.<br/>
* Now one thing to note is you will never have a single UAV satisfying all the mission parameters, instead, all the parameters of the UAV will lie in a certain range and of course will heavily depend on one another.

Now before we go into how to determine these parameters let’s look at the governing [equations for fixed-wing flight](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/cruise.html)<br/>
Now how to go from there to range and endurance?(remember we said something about it in mission parameters)<br/>
Well you just equate power required to battery power: TV = power-required.

Just a note this is only for steady level flight, a lot more configurations are possible. If you are interested you could go through the following: 
* **[Ascent](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/climb.html)**
* **[Gliding flight](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/glidang.html)**.<br/>

Now after this we will cover the weight iteration technique. It will be covered in the live session.
