Hello Everyone

Welcome to our TSS course from Learner's Space organised by Carrer Cell with Aeromodelling Club! We hope you’re ready for an engaging,rewarding learning experience in designing Aircrafts using XFLR5.

What do you think...

   •Why do fighter jets have delta wings while a commercial airliner does not? 
   •Why do the wings angle up in some planes and angle down in others?
   •Why scaling down a Boeing 747 gives you an RC plane which would never fly?  
   •Why are there so many configurations to make a simple RC plane? How do parameters of a fixed wing drone change with each mission? 

…Aircraft Design is full of such mysterious questions and we with this course want to help you answer them.
