# Week 1
Welcome to the course! <br />
In this week we will cover - 
* Plane Anatomy
* Airfoil design and analysis
* Interpreting airfoil data, Cl vs Alpha and drag polar, selection of airfoil
* Airfoil Analysis in XFLR5
<br />
To make sure that you understand things well, we have given a brief description of the topics followed by links. It is okay if you don't understand everything in the first go we will take your doubts in live webinars. 

## Plane Anatomy
There are many parts of an airplane and each has its own specific purpose. Letâ€™s look at the main components of an airplane and get a better understanding of their function.
The principal structural units of a fixed-wing aircraft are the fuselage, wings, stabilizers, flight control surfaces, and landing gear
