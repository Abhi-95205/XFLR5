# Week 1
Welcome to the course! <br />
In this week we will cover - 
* Plane Anatomy
* Airfoil design and analysis
* Interpreting airfoil data, Cl vs Alpha and drag polar, selection of airfoil
* Airfoil Analysis in XFLR5
<br />
To make sure that you understand things well, we have given a brief description of the topics followed by links. It is okay if you don't understand everything in the first go we will take your doubts in live webinars. 

## Plane Anatomy
There are many parts of an airplane and each has its own specific purpose. Letâ€™s look at the main components of an airplane and get a better understanding of their function.
The principal structural units of a fixed-wing aircraft are the fuselage, wings, stabilizers, flight control surfaces, and landing gear
* **[Aircraft Parts and Function](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/airplane.html)**: In this you will get to learn about the constructive features of the fixed-wing aircraft and you will be able to identify the primary, secondary, and auxiliary flight control surfaces.     
* **[Wing Geometry and definations](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/geom.html)**: This includes technical definitions of a wing's geometry, which is one of the chief factors affecting airplane lift and drag.

## Airfoil design and analysis
An airfoil is the shape of a wing or blade as seen in cross-section. An airfoil-shaped body movedthrough a fluid produces an aerodynamic force. The component of this force perpendicular to the direction ofmotion is called lift. The component parallel to the direction of motion is called drag. The design andoptimization of an airfoil is very important as it affects the lift produced by the wing of an aircraft or ahelicopter.
