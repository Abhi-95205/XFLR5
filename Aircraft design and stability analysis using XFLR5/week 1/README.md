# Week 1
Welcome to the course! <br />
In this week we will cover - 
* Plane Anatomy
* Airfoil design and analysis
* Interpreting airfoil data, Cl vs Alpha and drag polar, selection of airfoil
* Airfoil Analysis in XFLR5
<br />
To make sure that you understand things well, we have given a brief description of the topics followed by links. It is okay if you don't understand everything in the first go we will take your doubts in live webinars. 

## Plane Anatomy
There are many parts of an airplane and each has its own specific purpose. Letâ€™s look at the main components of an airplane and get a better understanding of their functions.
The principal structural units of a fixed-wing aircraft are the fuselage, wings, stabilizers, flight control surfaces, and landing gear
* **[Aircraft Parts and Function](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/airplane.html)**: In this you will get to learn about the constructive features of the fixed-wing aircraft and you will be able to identify the primary, secondary, and auxiliary flight control surfaces.     
* **[Wing Geometry and definations](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/geom.html)**: This includes technical definitions of a wing's geometry, which is one of the chief factors affecting airplane lift and drag.

## Airfoil design and analysis
An airfoil is the shape of a wing or blade as seen in cross-section. An airfoil-shaped body moved through a fluid produces an aerodynamic force. The component of this force perpendicular to the direction of motion is called lift. The component parallel to the direction of motion is called drag. The design and optimization of an airfoil is very important as it affects the lift produced by the wing of an aircraft or a helicopter.

## Interpreting airfoil data, Cl vs Alpha and drag polar, selection of airfoil
This topic will be covered in a live webinar

## Airfoil Analysis in XFLR5
Please download the XFLR5 software from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xflr5/files/latest/download). <br/>
You can find airfoil database [here](https://m-selig.ae.illinois.edu/ads/coord_database.html).
* **[Foil analysis](https://youtu.be/U7saOcozpi8 )**: In this you will learn how to use XFLR5 program to perform a plane analysis starting with foil design to the stability of analysis of complete plane.
* **[Foil Batch analysis](https://youtu.be/O4qlA_hjORc)**: This gives an overview of how to do batch analysis for the two foils at the same time, also gives an idea of how to decide the range the values to get a better graph. 
* **[Type 4 Polar](https://youtu.be/7obBVeD7wd8)**: In this you will get to know how to use polars to get different colors for each curve.
* **[Flapped foil design](https://youtu.be/xmalG5VS47g)**: In this you will learn about the impact of flaps on the performance of foil. 
* **[Inverse foil design](https://youtu.be/JmWNR1O4Jdc)**: This gives an idea of how to optimise the shape of any foil and then deduce what the geometry of the foil needs to be to match the velocity profile.  
* **[Polar mesh](https://youtu.be/QfGSKCrv-Ps)**: This helps to do 2d and 3d analysis of foil to evaluate the viscous drag using polar mesh.


The [Assignment1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aRewQEzmiGXJ9ts91aOBTVnjaJBZdX9c_QtPU32pcIg/edit?usp=sharing) will be used for evaluation of the course, hence you are expected to complete that within the week.
